<h1 align="center" style="background-color:gray;">Howdy, I'm Keller! Welcome to my page!</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">I am a Senior Tech Management major at Texas A&M. I currently work on campus with Technology Services. In my free time, I play tuba with the Hullabaloo band and I enjoy playing video games. I have a cat named Teeny (pictured below) and I enjoy taking naps. I plan on graduating in the Spring 2024 semester. I am hoping to have an internship on campus with Technology Services next spring. I was born and raised in West Texas before moving to Victoria Texas when I was little, which is where my family is still at. I have 2 younger siblings, a brother and sister who are both very cool. If you have any questions my email is kelrar@tamu.edu. Thank you for stopping by! </p>

<p align="center" style="font-family:Monospace"> I am a Senior Technology Management major at Texas A&M. I am currently working as a server here in College Station, but I am looking for an internship in the summer! I am from Austin, but I am open to moving to a different city in Texas or even out of the state/country. In my free time I love to workout, go to concerts, and watch tv/movies. If money was not a problem, I would probably spend my time traveling around the world. Thanks for visiting my page! </p>
